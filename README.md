# TCF36

Extended version of MHIT36 for turbulent channel flow.
Finite-difference code based on the fractional step method.
Solution of Navier-Stokes equations + phase-field method (ACDI).

Time integration, two options:
- All the terms explicit using RK3 (for both NS + PFM, working)
- CN for z-diffusive terms and RK3 for the rest of the terms (to be implemented, only skeleton is present), PFM is explicit.

# How to run the code
## 1. Compile cuDecomp
- First, build the **cuDecomp** library using the corresponding `*_lib.sh` script.  
- The resulting files will be located in:
  - **Library:** `cuDecomp/build/lib`  
  - **Headers:** `cuDecomp/build/include`  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that cuDecomp is compiled using **NVIDIA HPC-SDK**.  

## 2. Multi-GPU Source Code
- The folder **`multi/`** contains the source code for the **multi-GPU** version.  
- To compile and run:
  - Use `local.sh`, `leo.sh`, or `mn5.sh` depending on your system.  
- The multi-GPU version relies on **cuDecomp** for:
  - Pencil decompositions and transpositions  
  - Halo exchanges between GPUs  

## 3. Autotuning of Multi-GPU Decomposition
- By default, `pr=0` and `pc=0` enable **autotuning** when cuDecomp is initialized.  
- cuDecomp will automatically determine the best process decomposition at runtime.  
- The only required input is the **total number of MPI tasks**.  
- ‚úÖ This means you **do not need to recompile** the code when changing the number of MPI processes.  

## 4. Conditional Compilation Flags
- **Phase-field module**: Can be enabled or disabled. By default, only single-phase is used.  
- **Implicit diffusion along z**: Can be enabled or disabled. ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is **not yet implemented**.
