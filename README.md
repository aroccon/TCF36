# TCF36

Extended version of MHIT36 for turbulent channel flow.
Finite-difference code based on the fractional step method.
Solution of Navier-Stokes equations + phase-field method (ACDI) + energy equation (passive scalar).

Time integration, two options:
- Fully explicit: Euler explicit for ACDI + RK3 for Navier-Stokes and temperature
- Implicit CN for z-diffusive terms of Navier-Stokes equations and RK3 for the rest of the NS terms, RK3 for temperature and Euler explicit for ACDI. This latter option is not fully implemented, only the skeleton and the TDMA are present.

## How to run TCF36
**Compile cuDecomp**  
- Build the library using the provided `*_lib.sh` script.  
- Output locations:  
  - **Library:** `cuDecomp/build/lib`  
  - **Headers:** `cuDecomp/build/include`  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Compile using **NVIDIA HPC-SDK**.  

**Compile & run Multi-GPU version**  
- Source code in **`multi/`**.  
- Use `local.sh`, `leo.sh`, or `mn5.sh` depending on your system.  
- Relies on cuDecomp for pencil decomposition, transpositions, and halo exchanges.  

**Autotuning of decomposition**  
- Default: `pr=0` and `pc=0` ‚Üí enables **automatic process decomposition**.  
- Only input needed: **total number of MPI tasks**.  
- ‚úÖ No recompilation required when changing MPI processes.  

**Optional features (conditional compilation)**  
- **Phase-field module:** Can be enabled or disabled. Default is single-phase.  
- **Implicit diffusion along z:** Can be enabled or disabled. ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented.
