Direct numerical simulation of fully developed flow at different Reynolds numbers in a plane channel have been performed using the spectral numerical method of Kim, Moin and Moser (J. Fluid Mech. vol 177, page 133). 
The friction Reynolds numbers of the simulations is 180.
The details of the simulations are described in  Moser, Kim  and Mansour ( Phys. Fluids, vol 11(4) , page 943).
